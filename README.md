# 🩺 MediLens: Your Health Data, Decoded.

> **"Science and Magic, united for better health."**

MediLens is a privacy-first intelligent companion that bridges the gap between complex medical reports and patient understanding. By fusing the mathematical precision of Google ML Kit with the reasoning capabilities of Gemini 3.0 Flash, MediLens transforms dense, jargon-heavy lab reports into clear, actionable health stories—all while keeping your data secure on your device.

### 🚀 Key Features

* **🛡️ Edge-First Privacy (Zero-Persistence)**: Session-based architecture ensures medical data vanishes from memory once the app closes.
* **🧠 Hybrid Intelligence Engine**: Combines ML Kit's deterministic OCR for facts with Gemini 3.0's empathy for context.
* **🚦 Instant Visual Triage**: Color-coded traffic light system (Green/Amber/Red) instantly flags normal vs. critical results.
* **📂 Multi-Source Ingestion**: Smartly captures and processes reports from PDF documents, gallery images, or live camera.
* **🗣️ Plain English Translator**: Converts complex medical terminology into simple, reassuring summaries for non-experts.
