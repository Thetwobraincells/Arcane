### 🚀 What is this?
Medical reports are usually confusing and dull. **Medical Dashboard** solves this by organizing patient data into a sleek, dark-mode interface that highlights what matters. It uses visual cues (glowing indicators, color-coded alerts) to help users instantly spot critical health trends—just like technology from Piltover.

### ✨ Key Features
* **🔮 Hextech UI**: A custom-built, glowing dark theme that makes data pop.
* **📊 Smart Dashboard**: Instantly see total reports, test counts, and critical alerts at a glance.
* **⚠️ Auto-Alerts**: Automatically flags "High" or "Critical" values with red warning indicators.
* **⚡ Instant Analysis**: Loads and parses patient test results in real-time (simulated data).
* **📱 Cross-Platform**: Built on Flutter to run smoothly on Mobile and Web.
